# This is the file containing default values for all options you can specify for the plotting
# script at runtime via YAML input.
# Details about the specific sections (groups of variables for a particular purpose) and
# individual variables can be found in the comments above each specific section/variable below.
#
# Some sections also include subsections with further settings related to a particular part of
# the plotting script; these are differentiated by the indentation level.
#
# Some variables must be specified in the plot_options.yaml file (the default values are invalid);
# these variables are labeled "(mandatory)".

# This section is for variables related to the specific data you want to plot
data:
  #
  # filename (mandatory):
  # Full or relative path to filename containing MPAS data you wish to plot. Can be a single file,
  # a glob-able regex pattern match (e.g. /path/to/nc/data/*.nc), or a list of files
  # 
  # gridfile:
  # Some MPAS files (usually "diag" files) do not contain grid information; in these cases you
  # must specify a "gridfile" that contains the grid information for the script to read
  # NOTE: Since only one gridfile can be specified, it is not possible to mix-and-match gridded
  #       and gridless files
  #
  # var:
  # Variable name to plot. Can be a list of variable names, or the string "all" (default).
  # 
  # lev: Variable level to plot (for variables with multiple vertical levels). Can be a list of
  # level numbers, or the string "all". Default is level 1.

  # Note that for 'var' and 'lev', unless you are specifying "all", you must provide a list of
  # values, even if there is just one item in that list. Some specific examples of how to specify
  # various combinations of variable and levels are provided below.

  # To plot all variables at the 9th vertical level, use the following settings:
  #   var: all
  #   lev:
  #     - 9
  # To plot the variables qv and rho at all levels, use the following settings:
  #   var:
  #     - qv
  #     - rho
  #   lev: all
  # To plot the variable t2m at levels 1 through 6, use the following settings:
  #   var:
  #     - t2m
  #   lev:
  #     - 1
  #     - 2
  #     - 3
  #     - 4
  #     - 5
  #     - 6

  filename: ''
  gridfile: ''
  var: all
  lev:
    - 1

# This section is for variables related to how the plot(s) is/are created.
plot:
  # filename:
  # The filename of the output plot(s).
  # 
  # title:
  # The title of the output plot(s) that will appear in the image above the plotted data. To create
  # a plot with no title, set this to a blank string.
  #
  # latrange:
  # Range of latitudes to plot. Should be a 2-element list, with the first entry being less than the second
  #
  # lonrange:
  # Range of longitudes to plot. Should be a 2-element list, with the first entry being less than the second
  #
  # periodic_bdy:
  # For periodic domains (including global), the plot routines will ignore the periodic boundary by default.
  # To plot all data, including boundaries, set this option, but it will slow down plotting substantially.
  #
  # colormap:
  # Colormap for output from Matplotlib. Reference documentation for valid options:
  # https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html
  #
  # dpi:
  # Image dots per inch
  #
  # figheight:
  # Image height in inches
  # 
  # figwidth:
  # Image width in inches


  # NOTE: for text fields such as filename, title, etc., some helpful variables are provided that
  # you can reference in the text string that will be substituted in the final output:
  # {var} = Variable name
  # {lev} = Variable level
  # {varln} = Variable "long name" (not recommended for filenames since these often contain spaces)
  # {units} = Variable units
  # {filename} = Name of file being read for plotted data
  # {fnme} = Name of file (minus extension) being read for plotted data
  # {date} = The date of plotted data, in %Y-%m-%d format
  # {time} = The time of plotted data, in %H:%M:%S format
